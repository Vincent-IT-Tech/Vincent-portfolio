I’m a **Network & Systems Specialist** with over 2 years of experience supporting IT systems in manufacturing and operational environments.

I specialize in maintaining reliable and secure IT infrastructure, including ERP systems, POS platforms, factory networks, and production-support systems. In my current role at Spinners and Spinners Ltd, I provide end-to-end IT support for manufacturing operations, ensuring the availability and stability of ERP, inventory, dispatch, and weighing systems that directly impact production output.

My expertise includes network setup and troubleshooting, firewall configuration, routing and switching, and system administration across Windows, Linux, and macOS environments. I work closely with production teams and vendors to resolve issues quickly, minimize downtime, and ensure smooth day-to-day operations.

This portfolio showcases my technical skills and practical experience delivering real-world IT solutions in live production environments.
